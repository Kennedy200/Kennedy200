 Hi, I'm Kennedy 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on innovative web apps that bridge the gap between user needs and seamless experiences, like a Virtual Pet Care Assistant 🐾.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced AI integrations to add a bit more "smart" to the tech I build.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that solve real-world problems with clean, scalable code.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with exploring cutting-edge machine learning frameworks to integrate into full-stack projects.
- 💬 Ask me about React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, or even how to craft tech content that connects!
- 📫 How to reach me: kennedychigozie883@gmail.com  /  +234-705-723-3318 📧
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him (but call me "Full Stack Extraordinaire" 😉)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once built an entire web app while writing a blog post about it. Multitasking is my superpower!
